  A short game sheds light on government policy, corporate America and why no one likes to be wrong.

  Here’s how it works:
</p>
<p>


We’ve chosen a rule that some sequences of three numbers obey — and some do not. Your job is to guess what the rule is.
</p>
<p>


We’ll start by telling you that the sequence 2, 4, 8 obeys the rule:
</p>

  <ul>
    <li>2, 4, 8 Obeys the rule</li>
  </ul>
<p>
  Now it’s your turn. Enter a number sequence in the boxes below, and we’ll tell you whether it satisfies the rule or not. You can test as many sequences as you want.
</p>

<% if @all_numbers != nil %>
<ul>
    <% @all_numbers.each do |scrote| %>
<li>
<%= scrote.first_guess %>,
<%= scrote.second_guess %>,
<%= scrote.third_guess %>
<%= scrote.outcome %>
</li>
<% end %>
</ul>
<% end %>
<p>
  Enter a sequence:

  When you think you know the rule, describe it in words below and then submit your answer. <strong>Make sure you’re right; you won’t get a second chance.</strong>
</p>

<form action="/show_answer">
    <label for="your_answer">Your answer:</label>
  <div>
    <textarea id="your_answer" name="q" placeholder="Describe what you think the rule is"></textarea>
  </div>
